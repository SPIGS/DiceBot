# Info
> DiceBot is a bot that provides DM's with a means of playing Dungeons and Dragons on Discord. 

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

Currently that bot can:
 - Roll dice of any size from d2 to d100 (even physically impossible dice like a d3 if you really need it)
 - Provides a full list of all Dungeons & Dragons spells and equipment and their descriptions / stats

In the future, the bot will (hopefully) be able to:
 - Manage characters and charactersheets
 - Manage encounters
 - Support for more tabletop roleplaying games

# Instructions For Use
1. Create discord bot account and add it to your channel (plenty of Youtube videos on this).
2. Run diceboy.py using
```
python3 dicebot.py
```
3. When prompted, enter in your bot's token and your desired command prefix
