# Info
DiceBot is a bot that provides DM's with a means of playing Dungeons and Dragons on Discord. 

Currently that bot can:
 - Roll "dice" of any size from d2 to d100 (even physically impossible dice like a d3 if you really need it)
 - Provides a full list of all Dungeons & Dragons spells and equipment and their descriptions / stats

In the future, the bot will (hopefully) be able to:
 - Provide the same access to monster manual documentation as it currently does with spells and equipment
 - Manage characters and charactersheets
 - Manage encounters

# Instructions For Use
1. Create discord bot account and add it to your channel (plenty of Youtube videos on this).
2. Add your token to the bottom of either dicebot(old).py or dicebot.py
3. Create a .bat file to run either file
4. ???
5. Profit


It should be noted that dicebot.py offers additional commands, however they offer no utility and are currently for testing purposes.
